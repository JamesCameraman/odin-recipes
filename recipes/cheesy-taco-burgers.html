    <h2>A Wonka-like creation</h2>

    <p>Taco night meats the drive-thru!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning</li>
        <li>3 thick slices Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>3 hamburger buns, split</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix ground beef and taco seasoning together in a bowl. Set in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to let taco mix infuse into the beef.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove meat from the refrigerator and make 6 very thin patties. Place a slice of Cheddar cheese into the center of 3 patties. Place the remaining patties on top of the cheese patties and seal together by pinching the ends.</li>
        <li>Cook on the preheated grill for 6 to 7 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until no longer pink, 6 to 7 minutes more. Place on hamburger buns.</li>
    </ol>
